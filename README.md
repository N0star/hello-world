## Hello world!

Welcome to my little repository intended as a testing ground to learn GitHub mechanics!
Please don't mind if most stuff here's gonna be a little meaningless...
On the contrarty, if you somehow find anything useful here, feel free to use it ^^.


### Jekyll Themes
Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/N0star/hello-world/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
